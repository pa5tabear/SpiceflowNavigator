# Sprint 10 Reflection

## Part 1: Executive Summary of Action
The integration test was executed using `pytest` and completed successfully. The transcription
API returned the string:

```
Thank you.
```

## Part 2: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of Failures & Challenges
No failures occurred during the test run. Prior to execution we installed the project dependencies
and ensured the source directory was on `PYTHONPATH` so the test could import the client module.

## Part 3: Final Analysis
### Lessons Learned
- Always verify that all runtime dependencies are installed before running integration tests.
- Adding the project `src` directory to `PYTHONPATH` avoids import errors in projects without a
  packaged module.
- Keeping environment variables like `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT` preconfigured is essential for repeatable
  integration testing.

### Process Recommendations
- Automate environment setup steps such as dependency installation and environment variable
  configuration in the CI pipeline to remove manual preparation.
- Maintain simple integration tests that exercise the primary user workflow to catch regressions
  early.
