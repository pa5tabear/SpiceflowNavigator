# Sprint 11 Reflection

## Part 1: Executive Summary of Action
A unit test (`tests/test_cli.py`) was introduced to drive development of a new
command line interface. The CLI implementation lives in
`src/spiceflow/cli.py` and exposes a `main` function callable by `argparse`.
The test mocks `RunPodClient` to avoid network calls and verifies that
`cli.main` passes the provided audio URL to the client's `run` method and
prints the returned transcript. After implementation all tests, including the
new one, passed successfully.

## Part 2: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of Failures & Challenges
No major failures occurred. The main challenge was ensuring the path used by
`patch` matched the import location of `RunPodClient`. Adding the project `src`
directory to `PYTHONPATH` and patching `spiceflow.cli.RunPodClient` resolved the
issue.
