# Sprint 13 Reflection

## Part 1: Executive Summary of Action
This sprint introduced an automated `WorkflowManager` which fetches podcast audio
URLs from an RSS feed and stores the transcriptions as Markdown files.
A new unit test (`tests/test_workflow.py`) was written first and failed because
the manager module did not exist. After implementing `WorkflowManager` and an
executable `run_workflow.py` script, all tests pass.

## Part 2: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of Failures & Challenges
Sprint 12 did not include a reflection file. The omission happened because the
engineering workflow focused solely on code changes and neglected the
post-sprint documentation step. To prevent this, the checklist for closing a
sprint now explicitly includes creating a reflection document before merging any
code. This ensures that every sprint captures lessons learned and key metrics.

## Part 3: Success Metrics
- **Tests Passed:** 8/8
- **Code Churn:** 115 lines
- **Time-to-complete:** 1 hour

## Part 4: Final Analysis
### Lessons Learned
- Writing the failing test first quickly highlighted missing modules and guided
the design of the workflow.
- Mocking network interactions keeps the tests fast and reliable.

### Process Recommendations
- Maintain the reflection-file checklist so every sprint documents its outcome
and metrics.
