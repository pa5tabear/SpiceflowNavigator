# Sprint 16 Reflection

## Part 1: Executive Summary of Action
This sprint added an integration test that launches `run_transcription_job.py` and checks for a returned job id. The test initially failed because the script did not exist. After implementing the script and updating the test to set `PYTHONPATH`, the suite passes with the job test skipped when secrets are absent.

## Part 2: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of Challenges
**Observation:** Running the new integration test produced a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `spiceflow`. The subprocess invocation lacked the correct `PYTHONPATH` so the script could not import project modules.

**Hypothesis:** The environment spawned by `subprocess.run` did not inherit the repository's `PYTHONPATH`. Without the `src` directory on the path, Python could not locate the package.

**Workarounds:** Adding the `src` directory to `PYTHONPATH` within the test environment resolved the import error. No other workarounds were required.

## Part 3: Proposed Next Sprint (Problem Decomposition)
The next sprint should focus on retrieving the transcription result using the job id returned this sprint. Steps include:
1. Poll the RunPod API for job status until completion.
2. Download the transcript once available and store it locally.
3. Add integration tests that validate end-to-end retrieval when secrets are configured.
