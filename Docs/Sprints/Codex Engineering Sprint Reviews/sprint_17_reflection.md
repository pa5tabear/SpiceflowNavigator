# Sprint 17 Reflection

This sprint focused on process hardening by adding a pre-flight environment check and aligning the RSS configuration format.

## What Went Well
- New `env_check.py` script validates required environment variables and network access.
- YAML configuration now uses a structured format and is loaded via `spiceflow.config`.
- Test coverage remains above 90% and ruff reports no issues.

## What Went Poorly
- I initially ran `git clean` before adding new files, which removed work in progress. I had to recreate the files from memory.

## Improvements for Next Sprint
- Stage files before cleaning the repository to avoid accidental loss.
- Continue enforcing test-first workflow and linting checks to maintain code quality.
