# Sprint 18 Reflection

## Root Cause Analysis
The sprint introduced an end-to-end script for submitting a job and verifying its status. No major issues arose, but the RunPod API lacked a simple `get_job` function. The fallback implementation now queries the status endpoint directly when the helper is absent.

## Improvements
- Ensure future sprint plans align with the installed package versions.
- Continue maintaining test coverage for the golden path.
