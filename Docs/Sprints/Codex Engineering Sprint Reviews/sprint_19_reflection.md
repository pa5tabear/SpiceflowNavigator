# Sprint 19 Reflection

## Root Cause Analysis
The `job_status_checker.py` script imported `RunPodClient` from the `spiceflow` package. When executed outside the repository's configured `PYTHONPATH`, the import failed, leading to an `ImportError`. The script should not depend on internal modules for this simple status check.

## What Went Well
- Tests already covered the status checker, making regression easy to detect.
- The refactor to use `gradio_client` directly simplified the script.

## What Went Wrong
- Formatting tools modified unrelated files initially, causing unnecessary noise in the diff.

## Improvements for Next Sprint
- Limit formatter runs to touched files to avoid mass changes.
- Document environment variables in the README for easier local testing.
