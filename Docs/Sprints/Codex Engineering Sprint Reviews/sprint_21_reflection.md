# Sprint 21 Reflection

## Root Cause Analysis
Sprint 20 failed because the codebase still referenced the old RunPod Job API. The `status()` helper and API key check prevented the proxy-only flow from working and the CI pipeline errored.

## Improvements
This sprint removed the obsolete polling logic and updated all call sites to the new `transcribe` method. The environment check was simplified and additional tests now cover the core modules.
