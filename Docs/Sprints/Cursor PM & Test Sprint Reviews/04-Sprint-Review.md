### Progress & Status

Sprint 4 was a resounding success. It achieved its primary goal of creating an environment diagnostic tool that has provided us with a definitive, evidence-based understanding of our execution environment. The agent successfully built the script and included its output in a clear, well-structured reflection.

**Key Discoveries:**
*   **Internet Access:** Confirmed to be **DISABLED**.
*   **Secret Injection:** Confirmed to be **ENABLED**.
*   **Dependencies:** Confirmed to be **MISSING** as a result of no internet.

While functional progress on the application remains at 0%, the value of this sprint is immense. We have moved from a state of confusion to a state of clarity. The diagnostic tool is a permanent asset that will help us validate any future environment changes.

### Blockers, Costs & Decisions

*   **Blocker:** The sole blocker for the entire project is now the lack of internet access within the execution environment, which prevents `pip install`.
*   **Costs:** This sprint incurred zero API costs.
*   **Decision:** The next sprint must be laser-focused on solving the dependency installation problem. We will not attempt any feature work until we have a reliable way to install our required packages.
