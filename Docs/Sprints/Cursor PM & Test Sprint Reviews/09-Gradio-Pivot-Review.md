# PM & Test Review: Sprint 09 (Gradio Pivot)

- **Season:** 1
- **Sprint:** 9
- **Status:** Completed
- **Review Date:** 2024-07-26

## 1. Progress & Status

**This sprint was a stunning success and a critical pivot for the project.**

The engineering team (Codex) successfully executed a complete refactor of the `RunPodClient`, moving it from a REST-based approach to the correct `gradio_client` implementation. This aligns our application with the actual target API, which was discovered to be a Gradio web application.

Analysis of the git history confirms that all tasks from the sprint plan were completed:
- The `requirements.txt` file was updated with `gradio_client`.
- The `RunPodClient` was completely rewritten, removing obsolete methods (`check_health`, `status`) and correctly implementing the new `run` method that uses `gradio_client.predict`.
- A new integration test (`test_runpod_transcribe.py`) was created to perform a live test against the Gradio endpoint.

This sprint has unblocked our primary goal: testing the podcast transcription service. We have moved from a position of guaranteed failure to one of potential success.

## 2. Blockers, Costs & Decisions

- **Blocker:** **Missing Engineering Review.** Codex did not produce a reflection document for this sprint. This is a critical gap in our process. Without the engineering team's "Root Cause Analysis," we lose valuable insight into *why* the initial API assumption was wrong and how we can prevent similar mistakes. This process requirement must be reinforced.

- **Decision:** Despite the missing reflection, the visible results (code changes and new tests) are sufficient to mark this sprint as complete and move forward. The risk of proceeding is low, as the next step is a full end-to-end test.

- **Cost:** The cost of this pivot was one "wasted" sprint (Sprint 8) spent planning for the wrong API. However, the cost of *not* pivoting would have been much higher, leading to multiple failed sprints and significant debugging. This was a necessary and valuable course correction.
