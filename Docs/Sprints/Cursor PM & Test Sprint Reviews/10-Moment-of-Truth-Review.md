# PM & Test Review: Sprint 10 (The Moment of Truth)

- **Season:** 1
- **Sprint:** 10
- **Status:** SUCCESS
- **Review Date:** 2024-07-26

## 1. Progress & Status

**SUCCESS! The proof-of-concept is officially validated.**

This sprint achieved its one and only goal: to execute the live integration test. The test passed, confirming that our refactored `RunPodClient` can successfully communicate with the live Gradio-based transcription service.

According to the engineering reflection, the API returned a successful transcription: `"Thank you."`

This marks the successful conclusion of our initial project phase. We have navigated significant challenges, including incorrect API assumptions, environment validation, and dependency issues, to arrive at a working end-to-end solution. The system, as designed, works.

## 2. Blockers, Costs & Decisions

- **Blockers:** There are no technical blockers.
- **Decision:** We have successfully proven the viability of using this RunPod service for transcription. The project can now move from the "proof-of-concept" phase to the "alpha" phase.
- **Next Steps:** The next season of sprints should focus on building a more robust application around this now-proven core functionality. This could include:
    - Building a simple CLI to use the client.
    - Integrating the RSS feed parser to create a full podcast-to-text pipeline.
    - Hardening the client with better error handling and logging.
    - Expanding the test suite with more diverse audio samples.
