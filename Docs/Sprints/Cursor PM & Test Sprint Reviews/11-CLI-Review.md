# PM & Test Review: Sprint 11 (Command-Line Interface)

- **Season:** 1
- **Sprint:** 11
- **Status:** SUCCESS
- **Review Date:** 2024-07-27

## 1. Progress & Status

**SUCCESS! The project has evolved from a library into a usable tool.**

The engineering team has successfully built the first user-facing application for our transcription service: a command-line interface (CLI). This delivers on the core goal of Sprint 11 and provides the first concrete way for a user to interact with our system.

The execution was flawless and adhered to our process standards:
- **Test-First Development:** A new test file, `tests/test_cli.py`, was created first to define the CLI's behavior.
- **Implementation:** The `src/spiceflow/cli.py` module was then created to satisfy the test.
- **Validation:** All unit tests, including the new CLI test and all previous tests, are passing.

This marks a significant step forward, turning our validated backend client into a tangible product.

## 2. Blockers, Costs & Decisions

There were no blockers in this sprint. The technical challenges encountered were minor and handled effectively by the engineering team, as noted in their reflection. The project remains on track and on budget.

The key decision now is to build upon this foundation. The next logical step is to integrate the RSS feed parsing capability we previously researched. This will allow the CLI to fetch audio from a live podcast feed, moving us closer to the ultimate product vision.
