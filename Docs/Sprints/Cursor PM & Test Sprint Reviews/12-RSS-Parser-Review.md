# PM & Test Review: Sprint 12 (RSS Feed Parser)

- **Season:** 1
- **Sprint:** 12
- **Status:** SUCCESS
- **Review Date:** 2024-07-27

## 1. Progress & Status

**SUCCESS! The project is now connected to the world of live podcast data.**

The engineering team has successfully built the `RSSParser`, a critical piece of backend infrastructure. This component allows our system to ingest a podcast feed and extract the necessary audio URLs for transcription.

Analysis of the git history confirms that all technical tasks from the sprint plan were completed:
- A local fixture of the target RSS feed was saved.
- A test-first approach was used to create `tests/test_rss_parser.py`.
- The `src/spiceflow/rss_parser.py` module was implemented successfully to make the tests pass.

This is the final prerequisite for building our end-to-end, automated transcription workflow.

## 2. Blockers, Costs & Decisions

**Process Gap:** A key blocker this sprint was the **absence of an engineering reflection file** (`sprint_12_reflection.md`). While the work appears successful based on the code, the lack of a reflection means we are missing valuable insight from the engineering team regarding challenges, key decisions, and success metrics. This is a process failure that we must correct in the next sprint.

Despite this, the project moves forward. The key decision is now to leverage our new `RSSParser` and the existing `RunPodClient` to create the Markdown-driven workflow we previously discussed.
