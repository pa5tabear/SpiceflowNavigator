### Progress & Status
- **Green badges turned on/off this sprint:** `tests/test_workflow.py` is now green.
- **Net LOC added:** 115 (66 code, 49 tests).
- **New capabilities now demo-able:** Yes. Running `python run_workflow.py` now automatically creates transcription files in the `transcripts/` directory for the latest two podcast episodes.

### Blockers, Costs & Decisions
- **Failing tests / CI steps:** None. All 8 tests are passing.
- **Merged TODO-comments count:** 0.
- **Decisions required from Project Owner:**
    - The next logical step is to build the `StrategicAnalyzer` to distill insights from these new transcripts. Please confirm this is the correct priority.
    - Please provide initial keywords, topics, or names you consider "strategically relevant" to guide the creation of the analysis prompt for the next sprint.
