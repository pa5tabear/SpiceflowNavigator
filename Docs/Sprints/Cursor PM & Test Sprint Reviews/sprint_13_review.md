### Progress & Status
- **Green badges turned on/off this sprint:** No new green badges were enabled.
- **Net LOC added (code vs tests):** The docs-to-code ratio is approximately 5:1. While sprint documentation is complete, the core `rss_parser` and `workflow` modules remain as blueprint files, not as running, tested code.
- **New capabilities now demo-able:** None. The last user-visible capability delivered was the CLI in Sprint 11.

### Blockers, Costs & Decisions
- **Failing tests / CI steps:** The RunPod live integration test is still failing due to an incorrect health check URL (`/healthz` instead of `/health`).
- **Merged TODO-comments count:** 0.
- **Decisions required from Project Owner:** This review serves to confirm the decisions outlined in the Project Owner's feedback. The key decision is to pivot from component-by-component planning to shipping a vertical slice in the next sprint.
