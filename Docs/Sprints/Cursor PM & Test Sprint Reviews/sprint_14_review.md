### Progress & Status
- **Green badges turned on/off this sprint:** None. No new code was delivered.
- **Net LOC added (code vs tests):** 0.
- **New capabilities now demo-able:** None.

### Blockers, Costs & Decisions
- **Failing tests / CI steps:** The entire sprint was a failure. No deliverables from the sprint plan were met. The engineering process appears to have broken down completely.
- **Merged TODO-comments count:** N/A.
- **Decisions required from Project Owner:** The Project Owner has made a key strategic decision: before any downstream logic (like analysis) is built, the next sprint must focus exclusively on proving the live transcription service works end-to-end. This means the next sprint will ingest a real RSS feed, fetch a real audio URL, and call the live RunPod API to get a transcript. This de-risks the most critical and expensive part of the system first.
