### Progress & Status
- **Green badges turned on/off this sprint:** None. No new code was delivered.
- **Net LOC added (code vs tests):** 0.
- **New capabilities now demo-able:** None.

### Blockers, Costs & Decisions
- **Failing tests / CI steps:** The entire sprint was a failure. No deliverables from the sprint plan were met. The engineering process appears to have broken down completely, as no work was performed and no reflection was provided to explain the failure.
- **Merged TODO-comments count:** N/A.
- **Decisions required from Project Owner:** We must decide how to proceed. I recommend **re-running Sprint 14 exactly as planned.** The plan was solid and based directly on your feedback; the failure was in execution, not strategy. We need to confirm that Codex can execute the specified tasks before creating new plans.
