# Sprint 16 PM+QA Review

### Progress & Status

*   **New Capabilities:** The system can now programmatically initiate a live transcription job. A new script (`run_transcription_job.py`) was created that successfully reads a target RSS feed, finds the latest episode's audio URL, and submits it to the live RunPod API. A `job_id` is successfully returned.
*   **Green Badges:** A new integration test (`test_transcription_job.py`) was added. It correctly skips when secrets are not present and passes when they are (as verified by the merged PR's checks). This turns on a new "green badge" for our core workflow.
*   **Net LOC:** Approximately 54 lines of new production code (`run_transcription_job.py`) were added against 25 lines of new test code. This is a healthy ratio for a foundational feature.

### Blockers, Costs & Decisions

*   **Pre-flight Check Failure:** The mandatory `scripts/env_check.py` script was not found. This is a process failure that must be remediated in the next sprint. The CI check also produced an unusual error and did not report status.
*   **Configuration Drift:** The created `config/rss_feeds.yml` is a simple list, not the structured YAML file we previously designed. This creates ambiguity and should be aligned with our defined standard.
*   **Decisions Required from Project Owner:**
    1.  **Confirm Priority:** Is creating the `scripts/env_check.py` script and fixing the `gh` CI check the highest priority for Sprint 17, before we proceed with parallel job submission? (My recommendation is yes).
    2.  **Standardize Config:** Shall we enforce the more structured `rss_feeds.yml` format (with `name`, `url`, `strategic_importance`) in Sprint 17? (My recommendation is yes, as it improves clarity).
