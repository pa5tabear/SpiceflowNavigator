# Sprint 17 PM+QA Review

### Progress & Status
*   **Green Badges:** This sprint was a success. Two new, critical green badges have been turned on:
    1.  A new `env_check.py` script now exists and is tested, providing a reliable gate for our pre-flight checklist.
    2.  A new `config.py` module properly loads and validates our standardized configuration, with its own successful unit tests.
*   **Net LOC:** Approximately 56 lines of new production code (`config.py`, `env_check.py`) were added, against 58 lines of new unit tests. This is a perfect 1:1 ratio, indicating high-quality, well-tested work.
*   **New Capabilities:** The project now has a robust, testable way to manage its configuration and verify its environment. The main `run_transcription_job.py` script has been simplified by refactoring its config-loading logic into the new module.

### Blockers, Costs & Decisions
*   **Failing Tests / CI Steps:** There are no failing tests. Based on the merged PR, CI is green.
*   **Merged TODO-comments:** None were identified in the review.
*   **Decisions Required from Project Owner:** No new decisions are required. The key blocker from Sprint 16 (the missing pre-flight check) has been successfully resolved. We are now in a position to proceed with our primary mission.
