# Sprint 17 PM+QA Review

### Progress & Status
*   **Green Badges:** Based on a review of the committed code, two new capabilities and their corresponding tests were added:
    1.  A new `env_check.py` script provides a gate for verifying the environment.
    2.  A new `config.py` module properly loads our standardized configuration.
*   **Net LOC:** Approximately 56 lines of new production code were added against 58 lines of new unit tests. This is an excellent 1:1 ratio.
*   **New Capabilities:** The project now has a robust, testable way to manage its configuration and verify its environment.

### Blockers, Costs & Decisions
*   **Failing CI Steps:** **UNKNOWN.** I am currently blocked from viewing live CI results due to a persistent local tooling error with the `gh` command. While the code *appears* correct and the PR was merged, I cannot independently verify the final CI status. This is a critical process gap.
*   **Merged TODO-comments:** None were identified.
*   **Decisions Required from Project Owner:** No new decisions are required, but the tooling issue preventing CI validation must be noted.
