# Sprint 19 Review: PM & QA Analysis

## Progress & Status
*   **Progress:** Codex successfully implemented the fix for the `ImportError` in `job_status_checker.py`, replacing the legacy `runpod` calls with the correct `gradio_client` implementation. This was the primary goal of the sprint.
*   **Status:** Despite the code fix, the **CI pipeline on the `main` branch is FAILING.** This means the branch is in a broken state.

## New Green Badges
*   None. The CI run for the merged PR failed.

## Net LOC Added
*   **Code:** -2 LOC (`scripts` and `src` directories)
*   **Tests:** +98 LOC (`tests` directory)
*   **Analysis:** This is an excellent ratio. The code became more concise while test coverage increased significantly, demonstrating a healthy consolidation of the logic.

## Capabilities Now Demo-able
*   None. Due to the CI failure, we cannot confidently demo any new capabilities. The intended capability—reliable end-to-end job submission and status checking—is not yet verified.

## Blockers, Costs & Decisions
*   **Failing CI Steps:** The CI run is failing. I am **BLOCKED** from identifying the specific failing step because my `gh run view` command is non-functional. This prevents me from performing my core review duties.
*   **Merged TODO Comments:** None.
*   **Decisions Needed from Project Owner:**
    1.  The **`main` branch is broken.** This must be the highest priority to fix in the next sprint.
    2.  The **Pre-Flight Checklist in Master Prompt v7 is too strict.** I was instructed to override two "abort" conditions. The prompt should be revised to allow progress on planning and review even if secrets are missing or the `main` branch is temporarily failing.
    3.  My **`gh` command-line tool is broken,** preventing me from viewing CI logs. This is a critical blocker for my role as QA.
