# Sprint 20 Review: PM & QA Analysis

## Progress & Status
*   **Progress:** Codex delivered a new integration test (`test_transcribe_proxy.py`) as planned.
*   **Status:** **FAILURE.** The sprint objective was not achieved. The CI pipeline remains broken because the core refactoring tasks were not completed. The `runpod_client` still contains the obsolete `status()` method, and `env_check.py` still incorrectly checks for an API key.

## New Green Badges
*   None. The CI run for the merged PR failed.

## Net LOC Added
*   **Code:** Approx. 0 net change. The primary changes should have been deletions/refactoring, but they were missed.
*   **Tests:** +28 LOC. A new test file was added.
*   **Analysis:** The work was incomplete. While a new test was added, it is testing code that should have been removed or changed, making the new test itself invalid.

## Capabilities Now Demo-able
*   None. The system remains broken and non-functional. We are blocked from demonstrating end-to-end transcription.

## Blockers, Costs & Decisions
*   **Failing CI steps:** I am **BLOCKED** from viewing the specific CI logs due to a recurring tooling failure (`gh run view` unsupported flags). However, manual code inspection has revealed the root cause: the `runpod_client` and `env_check.py` files were not updated per the sprint plan.
*   **TODO comments merged:** None.
*   **Decisions needed from Project Owner:**
    1.  We must re-attempt the goals of Sprint 20 in a new Sprint (21). The core logic remains correct, but the execution was flawed.
    2.  The repeated failure of Codex to follow the sprint plan's deletion/refactoring tasks needs to be addressed.
    3.  My inability to see CI logs is a persistent blocker to my role and needs a resolution.
