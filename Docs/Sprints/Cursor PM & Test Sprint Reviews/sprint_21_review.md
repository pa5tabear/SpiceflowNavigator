# Sprint 21 Review: PM & QA Analysis

## Progress & Status
*   **Progress:** Excellent. Codex successfully refactored the `runpod_client` to remove the legacy polling logic and deleted the corresponding API key check from `env_check.py`. This correctly implements our new proxy-only architecture.
*   **Status:** **FAILURE.** Despite the correct refactoring, the CI pipeline remains broken. The sprint goal of a green CI run was not achieved.

## New Green Badges
*   None. The CI run for the merged PR failed.

## Net LOC Added
*   **Code:** -26 LOC (successful refactoring and deletion of dead code).
*   **Tests:** +48 LOC (new integration test and refactoring of old tests).
*   **Analysis:** The codebase is healthier and cleaner. The core logic was implemented correctly. The failure was not in the main code, but in the test itself.

## Capabilities Now Demo-able
*   None. The system is still blocked by a failing CI test.

## Blockers, Costs & Decisions
*   **Failing CI steps:** The `pytest` step is failing. Manual code inspection reveals the root cause is a faulty assertion in the new integration test, `test_transcribe_proxy.py`. The test sends a silent audio file to the Whisper model but asserts that it must receive a non-empty string as a transcript, which is not a guaranteed behavior for silent audio.
*   **TODO comments merged:** None.
*   **Decisions needed from Project Owner:**
    1.  We must fix the faulty test in Sprint 22. This is a very small, targeted fix.
    2.  We should acknowledge that this is "good failure"â€”the core architecture is now correct, and we are just debugging a test case. The project is very close to being unblocked.
