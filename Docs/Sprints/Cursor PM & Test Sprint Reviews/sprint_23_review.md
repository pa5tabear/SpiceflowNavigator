# Sprint 23 Review: PM & QA Analysis

*   **Progress & Status:** Based on a `git diff` of the `origin/codex/fix-runpodclient-and-integration-test` branch, Codex has delivered work that appears to perfectly align with the goals of Sprint 23. The flawed integration test was deleted, a new, focused test was created, a script to generate a test audio file was added, and the `runpod_client` was modified, presumably to fix the timeout issue.
*   **New Green Badges:** CI status is **UNKNOWN** due to a persistent failure in my `gh` and `jq` command-line tooling. I cannot programmatically verify the result of the CI run.
*   **Net LOC Added:** The diff shows `115 insertions(+)` and `226 deletions(-)` on the branch, indicating a significant cleanup and replacement of test code, which is excellent.
*   **Capabilities Now Demo-able:** Assuming the unverified CI run is green, the core transcription capability should now be stable and reliable, unblocking further development.
*   **Blockers, Costs & Decisions:** The primary blocker is my broken tooling (`gh`, `jq`), which prevents me from fulfilling my QA gate role. This is a critical failure that must be addressed. The decision, as outlined in the next sprint plan, is to make fixing this tooling the highest priority.
*   **Failing CI steps:** CI status is UNKNOWN.
*   **TODO comments merged:** To be determined after the branch is merged.
*   **Decisions needed from Project Owner:**
    *   Please manually verify the CI status of the `codex/fix-runpodclient-and-integration-test` branch.
    *   Please approve the plan for Sprint 24, which prioritizes fixing the CLI tooling before merging the Sprint 23 work.
