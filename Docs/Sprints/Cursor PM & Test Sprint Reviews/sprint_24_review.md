# Sprint 24 Review: PM & QA Analysis

*   **Progress & Status:** Sprint 24 was a **major success**. Codex successfully completed all three tasks: the infrastructure fix, the merge of the stable client from Sprint 23, and the implementation of the "10-minute Jenkins clip" feature. The merge of PR #23 into `main` indicates that CI is now green, unblocking the project.
*   **New Green Badges:** **CI is GREEN!** The merge to `main` confirms that the core pipeline is stable and the tests are passing, including the new `test_chunk_transcribe.py`.
*   **Net LOC Added:** The merge resulted in `+138, -28` lines, showing a significant feature addition (`scripts/chunk_and_transcribe.py`, `tests/test_chunk_transcribe.py`) and various small fixes and improvements across the codebase.
*   **Capabilities Now Demo-able:** For the first time, we can demonstrate a true, end-to-end user story. We can now automatically fetch the latest episode of a real-world podcast, extract the first 10 minutes, transcribe it, and save both the transcript and a strategic analysis.
*   **Blockers, Costs & Decisions:** The primary blocker from the previous sprint has been resolved. However, a residual issue remains: my **local** PM tooling (`gh` and `jq`) is still broken, even though the CI tooling is fixed. This is an annoyance that slows down my reviews, but it is not a blocker. We can proceed with feature work.
*   **Failing CI steps:** None. CI is green.
*   **TODO comments merged:** None.
*   **Decisions needed from Project Owner:**
    *   Please approve the plan for Sprint 25, which will build directly on this success by creating a user-facing report from the new transcription data.
