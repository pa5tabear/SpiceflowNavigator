# Sprint 25 Review: PM & QA Analysis

*   **Progress & Status:** Sprint 25 was a **partial failure**. While the PR was merged and the CI checks are green, the primary goal of the sprint was not achieved. The new CI job successfully ran the transcription script, but it **failed to commit the resulting transcript file** back to the repository. The project is still missing its most important artifact: proof of a real, live transcription.
*   **New Green Badges:** CI on `main` is green, which is a positive sign. However, this is misleading, as the most critical success metric for the sprint was not met.
*   **Net LOC Added:** The merge of PR #24 introduced changes, but without the final data artifact, the net value is minimal.
*   **Capabilities Now Demo-able:** None. We still cannot *see* a transcript generated by our system. We are in the same state as we were at the end of Sprint 24.
*   **Blockers, Costs & Decisions:** The blocker is a repeated process failure in our CI/CD pipeline. We have now failed twice in a row to implement a CI job that can commit a file back to the repository. This has cost two full sprint cycles. The decision is to make a **third and final attempt** at this task in Sprint 26. If this fails, a major reassessment of our CI/CD strategy will be required.
*   **Failing CI steps:** The `produce-transcript` job in the `ci.yml` workflow passed its tests but failed to perform the `git push` action.
*   **TODO comments merged:** None.
*   **Decisions needed from Project Owner:**
    *   Please approve the plan for Sprint 26, which is another, more focused attempt to fix the `produce-transcript` CI job.
