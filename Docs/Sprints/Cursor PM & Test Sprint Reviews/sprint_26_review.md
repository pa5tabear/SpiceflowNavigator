# Sprint 26 Review: PM & QA Analysis

*   **Progress & Status:** Sprint 26 was a **BREAKTHROUGH SUCCESS** ðŸŽ‰. After 3 sprints of attempting CI automation, the simplified manual approach delivered exactly what was needed. PR #25 merged successfully, and most importantly, we now have our **first real transcript artifact** committed to the repository: `transcripts/shift_key/latest_30s.json`. The goal of proving live transcription capability has been achieved.

*   **New Green Badges:** CI remains green on main branch. The major success metric achieved is having an actual transcript file in our repository - the primary evidence that our transcription pipeline works end-to-end with real podcast audio.

*   **Net LOC Added:** Minimal code changes (+18/-4 LOC) focused on robustness improvements to RunPodClient. The sprint wisely prioritized delivery over new features, proving that sometimes less code is more value.

*   **Capabilities Now Demo-able:** We can now **show** a real transcript generated from Jesse Jenkins' "Shift Key" podcast. The JSON file contains actual transcribed content proving our end-to-end pipeline works with live RSS feeds and real audio content. This is the first tangible proof-of-concept artifact.

*   **Blockers, Costs & Decisions:** No major blockers remain for basic transcription capability. The manual execution approach eliminated the CI automation complexity that blocked Sprints 24-25. The simplified workflow proved that the core transcription logic was always functional - the issue was deployment automation, not the algorithm.

*   **Failing CI steps:** No failing CI steps - all checks are green.

*   **TODO comments merged:** No new TODOs introduced.

*   **Decisions needed from Project Owner:**
    *   Should we now scale up from 30-second clips to the originally planned 10-minute chunks?
    *   Do you want to add more podcasts beyond "Shift Key" to demonstrate broader applicability?
    *   Should we iterate on the transcript format/structure, or is the current JSON sufficient?
