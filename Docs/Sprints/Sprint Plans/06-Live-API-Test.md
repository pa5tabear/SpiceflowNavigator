# Sprint 6: Execute Live Test via CI/CD

## 1. Sprint Goal & Strategic Alignment

### 60-Minute Focus: Prove our core transcription functionality works by triggering the CI/CD pipeline and achieving a `PASS` on the live integration test.

### Product Vision Alignment
> This sprint transitions us from local, manual testing to automated, CI-driven validation. A passing build here is the ultimate proof that our entire technical stack—code, dependencies, and environment secrets—works together as intended. It validates our "Get Transcript" functionality in a repeatable, automated way, which is the cornerstone of a reliable product.

## 2. Sprint Tasks & Acceptance Criteria (The "Inner Loop")

### Task 1: Commit Existing Changes (15 minutes)
*   **Description**: The local repository contains several changes that need to be committed and pushed to trigger the new CI workflow. This includes the updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file and the reorganization of the `Docs` directory.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   [ ] All current unstaged changes are added to git.
    *   [ ] The changes are committed with a clear, descriptive message (e.g., "ci: Configure CI pipeline and reorganize docs").
    *   [ ] The commit is pushed to the remote repository.

### Task 2: Monitor CI and Analyze Results (30 minutes)
*   **Description**: Pushing the commit will trigger the CI workflow on GitHub Actions. Your job is to monitor this run and analyze its output.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   [ ] The CI workflow is triggered successfully.
    *   [ ] The "Run integration tests" step completes with a definitive `PASS` or `FAIL`. A `SKIPPED` result is a failure for this sprint.

### Task 3: Write Mandatory Post-Sprint Analysis (15 minutes)
*   **Description**: Write the mandatory reflection document for this sprint, focusing on the results from the CI pipeline.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   [ ] A new file is created at `Docs/Sprints/Codex Engineering Sprint Reviews/sprint_06_reflection.md`.
    *   [ ] The reflection's "Observation" section **must include a link to the GitHub Actions run**.
    *   [ ] The section must also include the **full logs** from the "Run integration tests" step.
    *   [ ] If the test **PASSED**: Your `Proposed Next Sprint` should focus on the "Parse RSS Feed" functionality.
    *   [ ] If the test **FAILED**: Your `Root Cause Analysis` must analyze the logs to form a hypothesis about the failure, and your `Proposed Next Sprint` must be a targeted experiment to fix it.
