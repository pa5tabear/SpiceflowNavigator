# Sprint 7: Investigate and Trigger CI/CD

## 1. Sprint Goal & Strategic Alignment

### 60-Minute Focus: Successfully trigger the CI/CD pipeline, get a definitive `PASS` or `FAIL` on the live integration test, and document the result.

### Product Vision Alignment
> The project's next critical step is to get a clear signal from our automated CI pipeline. A successful run validates our entire stack and unblocks all future feature development. An unsuccessful run will provide the data needed to fix the final blocker. This sprint is focused on getting that data.

## 2. Sprint Tasks & Acceptance Criteria (The "Inner Loop")

### Task 1: Trigger the CI Workflow (30 minutes)
*   **Description**: The goal is to make a small, insignificant change to the repository to trigger the CI workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. A simple way to do this is to add a comment to the README.md file.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   [ ] A minor change is made (e.g., adding a newline or a comment to README.md).
    *   [ ] The change is committed with the message "ci: Trigger CI workflow".
    *   [ ] The commit is pushed to the remote repository.
    *   [ ] The push successfully triggers the "CI" workflow on GitHub Actions.

### Task 2: Monitor CI and Analyze Results (15 minutes)
*   **Description**: Monitor the triggered CI run and analyze its output.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   [ ] The "Run integration tests" step completes with a definitive `PASS` or `FAIL`. A `SKIPPED` result is a failure for this sprint.

### Task 3: Write Mandatory Post-Sprint Analysis (15 minutes)
*   **Description**: Write the mandatory reflection document for this sprint.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   [ ] A new file is created at `Docs/Sprints/Codex Engineering Sprint Reviews/sprint_07_reflection.md`.
    *   [ ] The reflection's "Observation" section **must include a link to the GitHub Actions run**.
    *   [ ] The section must also include the **full logs** from the "Run integration tests" step.
    *   [ ] If the test **PASSED**: Your `Proposed Next Sprint` should focus on the "Parse RSS Feed" functionality.
    *   [ ] If the test **FAILED**: Your `Root Cause Analysis` must analyze the logs to form a hypothesis about the failure, and your `Proposed Next Sprint` must be a targeted experiment to fix it.
