# Sprint 10: Final Integration Test

- **Season:** 1
- **Sprint:** 10
- **Codename:** The Moment of Truth
- **Theme:** End-to-End Testing
- **Status:** READY
- **Start Date:** 2024-07-26
- **End Date:** 2024-07-26
- **Review Date:** 2024-07-26

## 1. Sprint Goal

The goal of this sprint is to execute the live integration test against the RunPod Gradio service to get a definitive pass/fail result for our core feature: podcast transcription.

## 2. Business & Engineering Context

After a critical pivot in Sprint 9, we now have a client that is correctly aligned with the target Gradio API. Codex has already created the necessary integration test, `tests/integration/test_runpod_transcribe.py`. All dependencies are in place, the environment has been validated, and the client has been refactored. The only remaining task is to run the test and analyze the result. This is the final step in our initial proof-of-concept.

## 3. Tasks

### Task 1: Execute the Integration Test

- **Action:** Run the integration test suite. Specifically, execute the `tests/integration/test_runpod_transcribe.py` file.
- **Environment:** Ensure the `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT` environment variable is set correctly to the Gradio application URL.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** The test must pass. A passing result means the client successfully connected to the service, submitted the job, and received a non-empty string as a transcription result.

## 4. Sprint Review

### Engineering Review (Codex)

- **Standard Reflection:**
  - What was the result of the sprint? (i.e., Did the test pass or fail?)
  - If it passed, what was the output? Please include the transcription result in your reflection.
  - If it failed, what was the error?
  - What was the outcome of running the test suite?
  - Were there any surprises?
- **Final Analysis:**
  - Based on this entire season of sprints, what are the biggest lessons learned about integrating with a new, third-party AI service?
  - What are the key recommendations for improving our process for future projects of this nature?

### Product & Test Review (PM)

- The PM will review the final test result.
- **If Pass:** The PM will declare the proof-of-concept a success.
- **If Fail:** The PM will work with the engineering team to analyze the failure and plan the next steps, which may involve another debugging sprint or a re-evaluation of the service.
