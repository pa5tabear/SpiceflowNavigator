# Sprint 19 ¬∑ Fix the Golden Path

## 1 ¬∑ Sprint Goal & Alignment
**Goal:** Fix the `ImportError` in `job_status_checker.py` and get a green CI run on the `main` branch.

**Product Vision Alignment:** 
> The entire project is blocked until we have a reliable, verifiable, end-to-end test that proves we can submit a job and check its status. This bug fix is the final step to unblock all future work on the transcription pipeline.

---

## 2 ¬∑ Tasks & Acceptance Criteria

### Pre-flight (must pass before Task 1)
- [ ] `python scripts/env_check.py` ‚úÖ
- [ ] Last `ci.yml` run is green.
- [ ] Template version is `1.2 (2025-06-09)`.

### Task Table (Rule of Three)
*Propose at most 3 tasks. If more are needed, the sprint scope is too large.*

| # | Task | Key Acceptance Criteria (Enforced by CI) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Fix `ImportError`** | Modify `scripts/job_status_checker.py` to remove the legacy `runpod` calls and use only the correct `gradio_client` library for checking job status. |
| 2 | **Validate with Tests** | Ensure the existing test `tests/unit/test_job_status_checker.py` passes after the fix. |
| 3 | **Achieve Green CI** | The final commit must result in a fully successful CI run on the `main` branch. |

---

## 3 ¬∑ New or Changed Interfaces
| Interface / Component | Change Description | Contract (Inputs / Outputs) |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/job_status_checker.py` | Bug fix: Replaced `runpod` with `gradio_client` | **Input:** `job_id` (str), **Output:** `status` (str) |
