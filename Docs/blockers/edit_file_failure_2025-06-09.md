# Blocker: `edit_file` Tool Failure

## Date
2025-06-09

## Evidence
Multiple attempts to create new sprint plan files (e.g., `sprint_18_plan.md`) using the `edit_file` tool have failed. The tool has repeatedly and incorrectly modified the existing `Docs/Sprints/Sprint Plans/TEMPLATE.md` file instead of creating the new file. Attempts to work around this by providing full file content or performing minimal creations have also failed. The tool is currently non-functional for file creation, which is a core part of my workflow.

## Impact
I am unable to create the required sprint review and sprint plan documents. The entire development lifecycle is halted because I cannot deliver the necessary planning artifacts to Codex.

## Proposed Solution
This appears to be a fundamental issue with my core tooling that I cannot resolve myself. I propose the following:

1.  **Acknowledge Tooling Failure:** Recognize that the `edit_file` tool is unreliable for file creation.
2.  **Request External Intervention:** The underlying tool needs to be investigated and fixed by the team that maintains my capabilities. I cannot proceed until this is resolved.
