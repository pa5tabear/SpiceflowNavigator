## 1 · Professional Goals (2025-2026)

| # | Goal | Target Horizon | Value to Current Role |
|---|------|----------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | **Deliver "Spiceflow Navigator" v1** – an internal tool that ranks podcasts, articles, and reports for relevance to our renewable-energy pipeline. | Q4 2025 | Keeps team ahead of policy & tech trends; reduces research time. |
| 2 | **Streamline Project Due-Diligence** – automate early-stage site screening and tariff analysis via Python/GIS scripts. | Rolling sprints | Accelerates green-field and expansion projects; cuts manual effort. |
| 3 | **Deepen Zoning & Interconnection Expertise** – build a repeatable parcel-filter workflow for distributed-generation siting. | 2025 field test | Expands pipeline opportunities and de-risks permitting. |
| 4 | **Enhance Industry Knowledge** – complete targeted certificates (e.g., clean-energy finance) and publish at least one internal white-paper. | 2026 | Strengthens in-house thought leadership and capital-raising conversations. |
| 5 | **Sustain High-Leverage Habits** – maintain weekly cadence for tidying, family check-ins, focused work blocks, and fitness. | Ongoing | Supports productivity, well-being, and consistent project delivery. |

## 4 · High-Level Action Paths

* **Navigator vertical slices** → RSS ingest ➜ transcript (mock) ➜ analysis ➜ markdown digest.  
* **Due-diligence scripts** → automate parcel queries, tariff look-ups, and NPV quick-checks.  
* **Expertise deep-dives** → dedicate Friday lunch block to zoning case studies & finance coursework.  
* **LLM integration** → prototype small, safe AI helpers locally; share findings in dev stand-ups.  
* **Habit scaffolding** → leverage simple timers & calendar nudges for cleaning, family, and workouts.
