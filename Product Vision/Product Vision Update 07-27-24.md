# Product Vision Update: 07-27-24

This document captures the strategic product vision for the Spiceflow Navigator application, transitioning from a command-line tool to a fully automated strategic insights platform.

## The User's Vision: The "Daily Briefing" Model

The user-stated goal for the application is to move beyond manual scripts and create a "push" system that delivers strategic insights automatically. The ideal user experience is described as:

> "Will we have a transcriber agent connected to the users' podcast app that creates transcriptions as soon as a new podcast epp becomes visible to the app? And then those transcriptions get massaged into daily strategic insights newsletters to the user each morning?"

This vision outlines a fully autonomous system with three key components:

1.  **The Watcher:** An agent that constantly monitors podcast feeds for new episodes.
2.  **The Thinker:** An analysis engine that distills raw transcripts into strategic summaries and ratings based on the user's goals.
3.  **The Communicator:** A delivery mechanism that formats these insights into a daily briefing and sends it to the user.

## Our Path to the "Daily Briefing"

Our current sprint plan and technical architecture are aligned to deliver this vision piece by piece. The current workflow is designed as a **batch process**, where episodes are processed sequentially, not all at once, to ensure stability.

The path from our current state to the final vision is as follows:

1.  **The Transcriber Agent (The "Watcher"):**
    *   Our `run_workflow.py` script, which is currently designed to be run manually, will be deployed to a server or a scheduled service like GitHub Actions.
    *   This scheduled task **is** the "transcriber agent." It will run hourly or daily, automatically checking for new episodes and triggering the transcription process, creating a near-real-time ingestion pipeline.

2.  **The Strategic Analysis (The "Thinker"):**
    *   The next major feature (Sprint 14) will be a `StrategicAnalyzer` component.
    *   This component will take the raw text from a completed transcript and use a Large Language Model to perform the analysis and rating you require. This will be integrated directly into the workflow.

3.  **The Daily Newsletter (The "Communicator"):**
    *   The final piece will be a `NewsletterGenerator`.
    *   This will be a separate, daily scheduled script that gathers all the analysis generated in the last 24 hours.
    *   It will format these insights into a clean, readable Markdown file or HTML email and deliver the "Daily Briefing" to you automatically.

Every sprint we execute is a deliberate step on the critical path to making this autonomous system a reality.
