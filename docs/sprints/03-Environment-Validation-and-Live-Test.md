# Sprint 3: Environment Validation & Live Test

## 1. Sprint Review & Retrospective (The "Outer Loop")

### Product Manager's Two-Paragraph Review

**Paragraph 1: Progress & Status**
> The agent's analysis of the previous sprint's `SKIPPED` test was excellent and correct. It rightly identified that the root cause was a missing `requests` dependency in its execution environment, which prevented the test from even checking for the `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT`. This demonstrates a high level of self-awareness. We are now pivoting this sprint to directly address this finding. No functional progress has been made, but we have a clear diagnosis of our primary technical blocker.

**Paragraph 2: Blockers, Costs & Decisions**
> The blocker is the unvalidated execution environment. We cannot trust any test results until we can prove that dependencies are installed and secrets are accessible. The decision is to dedicate this entire sprint to that validation. The cost will be one or more live API calls to the RunPod endpoint, which is necessary to get a final pass/fail signal.

### Next Steps & Human-in-the-Loop Flags
*   [ ] Create and populate `requirements.txt`.
*   [ ] Install dependencies from the new file.
*   [ ] Prove `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT` is accessible.
*   [ ] Get a definitive `PASS` or `FAIL` on the live integration test.
*   [ ] ðŸš© **FLAG**: The final outcome of this sprint (`PASSED` or `FAILED`) requires close human review. It is the most important signal of the project's viability.

## 2. Sprint Goal & Strategic Alignment

### 60-Minute Focus: Prove the execution environment is correctly configured by creating a `requirements.txt`, installing dependencies, verifying secret access, and getting a definitive `PASS` or `FAIL` from the live integration test.

### Product Vision Alignment
> We cannot build on an environment we don't understand. This sprint is a "meta-sprint" focused on the tooling and environment itself. By ensuring our build process is sound, we make all future work reliable. A `SKIPPED` test is ambiguous; a `PASSED` or `FAILED` test is valuable data. This sprint is about getting that data.

## 3. Sprint Tasks & Acceptance Criteria (The "Inner Loop")

### Task 1: Create and Install Dependencies (15 minutes)
*   **Description**: Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all project dependencies, and then immediately use it to install them.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   [ ] A `requirements.txt` file is created in the root directory.
    *   [ ] The file contains `pytest`, `requests`, `python-dotenv`, and `feedparser`.
    *   [ ] The command `pip install -r requirements.txt` is executed successfully immediately after file creation.

### Task 2: Create a Dedicated Secret-Access Test (15 minutes)
*   **Description**: To isolate the problem, create a new, simple test whose only job is to prove that the `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT` variable can be read from the environment.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   [ ] A new directory `tests/environment` is created with an `__init__.py` file.
    *   [ ] A new test file is created at `tests/environment/test_secrets.py`.
    *   [ ] The test asserts that `os.environ.get("RUNPOD_ENDPOINT")` is a non-empty string, but is skipped if the variable is not set.
    *   [ ] `pytest tests/environment/test_secrets.py` runs and passes.

### Task 3: Execute the Live Integration Test (20 minutes)
*   **Description**: With dependencies installed and secret access verified, re-run the integration test from Sprint 2. The goal is a definitive result.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   [ ] The command `pytest -m integration` is run.
    *   [ ] The test result is **NOT** `SKIPPED`. A `SKIPPED` result indicates a failure to complete this sprint's goal.
    *   [ ] The test result is either `PASSED` (ideal) or `FAILED` (acceptable, as it provides data).

### Task 4: Write Mandatory 1000-Word Reflection (10 minutes)
*   **Description**: As per the project template, you must now write a detailed reflection on the work completed during this sprint.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   [ ] A new file is created at `docs/sprints/sprint_03_reflection.md`.
    *   [ ] The file is approximately 1000 words long.
    *   [ ] **Crucially, the reflection must contain the first 12 characters of the `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT` value you read from the environment.** This proves you accessed the secret. For example: `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT starts with "https://abc123def456..."`.
    *   [ ] The reflection addresses: what you did, challenges faced, solutions tried, analysis of failures, and suggested next steps.
