# Sprint 4 Reflection

## Part 1: Executive Summary of Action
This sprint added `scripts/diagnose_environment.py`, a standalone script that probes dependency availability, secret injection, and network connectivity. After running the existing tests, the script was executed to capture an objective view of the environment.

## Part 2: Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

### Observation
```
# Environment Diagnostic Report

## Dependency Check
*   [✅] pytest
*   [❌] requests
*   [❌] python-dotenv
*   [❌] feedparser

## Secrets Check
*   [✅] RUNPOD_ENDPOINT: https://vp4c...

## Network Check
*   [❌] Internet Connectivity: Failed to connect to www.google.com

## Summary
*   **Conclusion:** The environment is missing critical dependencies and/or network access.
*   **Action Required:** Please ensure dependencies are pre-installed or that network access is enabled. RUNPOD_ENDPOINT must be injected as a secret.
```

### Hypothesis
The environment lacks outbound network access and several Python packages are absent. However, the `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT` secret is present, indicating secret injection functions correctly. Missing dependencies and offline conditions explain the pytest failures.

### Failed Workarounds
No workarounds were attempted. The diagnostic script's purpose was solely to verify the environment.

## Part 3: Proposed Next Sprint
* **Proposed Sprint Goal:** Identify a method to install dependencies without internet access.
* **Decomposed Tasks:**
  - Explore if an internal package mirror or offline wheel repository is available.
  - Extend the diagnostic script to attempt installs from that location.
  - Document a reliable setup process once dependency installation is resolved.
